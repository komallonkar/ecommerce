In Angular, when a component's properties change, Angular automatically re-renders the component's view to reflect those changes. So, when the products array is updated in the filterProductsByCategory() method, Angular detects the change and re-renders the component, which in turn re-renders the *ngFor loop in the template where the products are displayed. This re-rendering effectively triggers a call to productList() again because it's being called in the ngOnInit() lifecycle hook, which is executed every time the component is initialized or re-initialized.

So, indeed, you're correct; the productList() function is being called indirectly when the products array is updated in the filterProductsByCategory() method, which is triggered by the selection of a category. Therefore, you don't need to explicitly call productList() inside the filterProductsByCategory() method.
